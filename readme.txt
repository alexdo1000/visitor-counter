This program keeps track of the number of times a user has visited the webpage.
The number of visits is stored within a MySQL database.

The database should consist of a schema named visits which contains a table called
visitTable. This table should have two columns, one called id (INT) and one called 
date (DATETIME). The id is a primary key which is auto-incrementing. 

When a user visits the webpage, the date and time they visited the website is stored
into the database with a unique id.
